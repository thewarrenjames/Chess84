### Key Features
- Bots
- Timed Games
- Board Customization
- PGN Exporting

Programmed in C++ for the TI-84 Plus CE Calculator using the [CE C/C++ Toolchain](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain).

## Download

You can download Chess84 at [github.com/thewarrenjames/Chess84](https://github.com/thewarrenjames/Chess84) and [thewarrenjames.com/projects/chess84/Chess84.zip](https://thewarrenjames.com/projects/Chess84/Chess84.zip).

## Installation

### 1. Cesium

Your specific calculator might not require this to run programs, but if it does, download the latest release at [github.com/mateoconlechuga/cesium](https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/cesium).

### 2. Dependencies

I wasn't able to get this program working without downloading the CE libraries individually, so I would recommend downloading the `clibs_separately_in_zip.zip` at [github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/tag/v12.1](https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/tag/v12.1).

### 3. Uploading to the Calculator

Use [Ti Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) to upload the latest release to your calculator.  

You should now be able to play chess on your calculator!

### Pro Tip

The fastest way to go to any option is to type the path to get there.  
For example, to Reset All from anywhere, type `0366`. If already on the home page, type just `366`.  
Here's a short list of useful shortcuts:
- `314`: Save current game as PGN
- `361`: Reset Board
- `366`: Reset All

### Save PGN on Game Over

## FAQ

### Is this project current being maintained?
No, but feel free to contribute your own code to the project.  
After over a year and a half in development, I've moved onto other projects.

### How can I see the files on my calculator?
Use either [Ti Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw) or on your calculator type `2nd` `+` `2` `1`.

### Does the chess bot have a name?
BERNARD!

### What rating would you give the bot?
Coming from [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/), it feels like half the time Bernard plays like an 800, and the other half, he plays like a 1200.

### What is the game in the background of the home page?
I'm glad you asked! It's [Deep Blue versus Kasparov, 1996, Game 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Kasparov,_1996,_Game_1).
